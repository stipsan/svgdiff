# Braindump

Need to create one function that accepts two images (bitmaps?) as input.
The output is an image bitmap. The image bitmap can be drawn directly to another
`<canvas>`, or `<img>`, or `background-image`, support adaptors so various solutions
and their performance can be tested.
The same goes for input. Want to test other solutions, like OffscreenCanvas, rust + webassembly and a worker (which can use OffscreenCanvas) etc.
