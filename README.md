# svgdiff

A FINN.no HackDays January 2019 project to report the visual difference between two SVGs.

# TODO

- [x] Make it work (it compares SVGs like it's supposed to and the UX isâ€¦ okay, not horrible but also not great).
- [ ] Make it right (a11y, test coverage, code cleanup).
- [ ] Make it fast (Performance optimize loops and such, use workers, use OffscreenCanvas).
